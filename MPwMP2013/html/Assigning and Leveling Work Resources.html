			<p class="First-Paragraph">The creation of resource work assignments is the basis of project scheduling and resource allocations. Creating assignments can also be a detailed and complicated process. Knowing what the resource scheduling goals for the project are will help simplify how resource assignments are created. This module explains how resource assignments are created, unique views for assignmend created and resource leveling.</p>

			<p class="Header">Lesson 1: Overview of Assignments</p>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Understanding the concepts behind assignment creation will increase understanding of how assignments are formed. This lesson will help with understanding the scheduling theory, the calculations used during creating work assignments, and the software settings governing the assignments.</p>

			</ol>
			<p class="Section-Heading">Review of Task Types and Effort-Driven Scheduling</p>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Understanding task types and effort-driven settings are essential to understanding how assignments are created. Earlier we discussed what these terms mean and it would be helpful to review them before we discuss creating work assignments.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph"><span class="strong">Effort-driven</span>: When 1 person moves 10 boxes it could take 5 minutes per box or 50 minutes total. However, if 5 people move the boxes, it would take less time (10 minutes) because the work is divided across the resources. In this case, all work is equal. As long as the boxes are all moved, which resource moves which box is not important. The key to remember with effort-driven scheduling is: the work is divided over the resources and the time required to complete the task is shortened.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Project 2010 allows for 3 task types for scheduling:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span><span class="strong">Fixed Duration</span>: A fixed duration task is a task created with a fixed length of time. Fixed Duration tasks are also tied to dates. Resources will only be assigned if available to work between the start and finish dates of the task.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span><span class="strong">Fixed Units</span>: Fixed Units is the quantity of resource assigned to a task and is the default task type. The quantity can be expressed in hours or a percentage of a whole resource. Fixed Units means that the resource assignment quantity is fixed for the task. Using this task type will result in the quantity of the units assigned to a task coupled with the availability of the resource to determine the duration of the task. If a task duration changes or if the amount of work changes, the resource units will not change for the task.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span><span class="strong">Fixed Work</span>: The work of the task is fixed. Fixed work tasks are always effort-driven by default. The more resources assigned to the task, the less time the task will take to be completed because the work is divided over the resources. Fixed work tasks will be scheduled based on the quantity of the units of resources assigned and availability as stated on their resource calendar.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Paragraph">When coupled with the effort-driven option, the scheduling engine allows for 5 combinations of task type, effort-driven settings:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Fixed Duration, Effort-driven on</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Fixed Duration, Effort-driven off</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Fixed Units, Effort-driven on</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Fixed Units, Effort-driven off</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Fixed Work, Effort-driven on</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Paragraph">To create effective resource scheduling assignments it is imperative that the task types and effect-driven settings for the tasks are correct. Different settings deliver different results during assignment creation. For this reason, understanding the work of a task is the best place to start. Once the work is understood, it will be much easier to choose an appropriate task type and resource types required to complete the task.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Inserting the Work, Effort-driven and Type columns into the Task Entry table will display all of the information in a single view to allow for proofreading and resetting of the values as needed.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">To add the Work, Effort-driven and Type columns into the Task Entry table:</p>

			<p class="Paragraph"></p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Manually scheduled tasks vs. Automatic scheduled tasks:</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">The scheduling engine ignores task type and effort-driven flags for manually scheduled tasks. These values apply only to automatically scheduled tasks.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">If a task is changed from manual scheduling to automatic scheduling, the task type and effort-driven values become meaningful. The value for these fields will be picked up from the options default settings when the task is entered. These values should be rechecked when switching modes to ensure correctness.</p>
			<p class="Section-Heading">What is an Assignment?</p>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">The “what” of the project are the tasks which represent what work needs to be accomplished. The resources are the “who” or who will perform the work. The assignment is applying the resource to the task to create the “when” and for “how much ” (cost and time). How the assignment is created will result in different outcomes for the values in the assignment.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">The values used in creating the assignment will drive the result for the duration, work and quantity of the resource assigned to the task.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Example: A task, “Paint the room” is estimated to take 3 days at 8 hours per day. The task type is Fixed Units, effort-driven off and 1 painter has a rate of $30 per hour.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">The result of this assignment is:</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">24 hours of work for 1 painter to be completed over 3 days. The resource was applied to the task at 100% units and has full availability during the dates the task is planned.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">As a result of the assignment, we now have the “when”, which is the schedule dates of the task. We also have the “how much” which is 24 hours of work at $30 per hour or a cost of $720 to complete the task.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">If the task had been scheduled using 3 available painters to work at the same time and rate, the assignment outcome would be different:</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">The task would change to an effort-driven task. Each of the 3 painters will work 8 hours to complete the 24 hours of total work. They would each be scheduled for 1 day of work and the cost would remain at $720. The task now completes in 1 day’s time and 2 days earlier.</p>
			<p class="Section-Heading">Assignment Formula</p>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">The assignment formula contains 3 parts. Each part can be defined separately to best reflect the needs of the task. Determine on a task by task basis which pieces of information are required and which pieces should be calculated.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">The 3 pieces of information are: Duration, Work and Units</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">The formulas are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Units = Work / Duration</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Duration = Work / Units</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Work = Duration x Units</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Paragraph">Units are defined as the quantity of a resource.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>1 or 100% = 1 full person</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>.5 or 50% = ½ of a person</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Paragraph">Assignment unit values are represented as a percentage or decimal formats. The setting is a personal preference. The setting can be switched back and forth without consequence to the assignments.</p>

				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>400 hours of work / 10 days = 5 units (100%)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Paragraph">This example answers the following question: How many people, working 8 hours per day, will it take to complete the task in 10 days? The answer is 5 people.</p>

			<p class="Paragraph">The above assignments were created with the assumption that the resources were available during the scheduled times. If the resources are not available, the duration of the task for Fixed Unit and Fixed Work tasks will increase and the work will be scheduled when the resource becomes available. Fixed duration tasks are tied to dates. Resources must have availability between the dates of the task or the task might change duration to accommodate the resource availability. When scheduling a resource without availability between dates for a fixed duration task, the following error message will be returned.</p>

			<p class="First-Paragraph">In the previous lesson, we discussed the concepts of creating work assignments. Assignments will include more nuances and concerns involved in developing a realistic project schedule. This lesson will address a variety of variables that should be considered while creating resource assignments.</p>

			</ol>
			<p class="Section-Heading">Percentage Assignments</p>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Resources typically are not available to work full time on a task. To accommodate this need, percentage assignments may be created. The percentage will be a percentage of the time that a resource has available on their calendar.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">For example: A resource has 50% availability of their time to work on a given task. If the resources workday is 8 hours per day on their resource calendar, the assignment will result in 4 hours per day of work time on the task.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">In the example below a resource has been assigned 50% to a 5 day, fixed unit task. The resource has 8 hours per day available on her resource calendar. Since she is assigned at 50% units, she will is assigned to 20 hours of work or 4 hours per day during the 5 days. The work column did not have a value entered when the assignment was created.</p>

			</ol>
			<p class="Paragraph">In the next example, the resource was removed from the task. 40 hours was entered in the work column stating that the task will require 40 hours to complete. 5 days was left in the duration column and the 50% assignment was recreated.</p>

			<p class="Paragraph">In the example below, the 40 hour task has a resource assigned at 50% units and the duration of the task was recalculated to 10 days. The resource is available to work 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week and it will take 10 days to complete the task. If the resource had been unavailable during the 10 day time period, the task duration would have increased to accommodate the unavailable time.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">In the Resource Usage view below, the resource detail is on the top which shows that Larry Adams will work 4 hours per day for the length of the task. In the Task View below the Schedule view shows the start and end dates for the assignment.</p>

			<p class="Paragraph">This view may also be used to fine tune assignments. Hours may be entered per day to contour the assignement. There is also an automatic contour function available. By double clicking on the assignment (not the resource name), the assignment information box will appear. Work contour has several options: flat (default), back loaded, front loaded, early peak, late peak, turtle, and bell. Each of these will produce a slightly different work distribution for a task. Task dates might be moved to accommodate the contour.</p>

			<p class="Section-Heading">Delaying an Assignment</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">If a resource is not available during the performance of a task the work of the resource might be delayed. If the resource is one of many on the task, do all of the resources have to work together or can resources perform their work separately? Entering a delay will affect the assignment of one resource and will not affect the other assignments on the task. If the entire task is delayed, all resources assigned to the task will be affected.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">To delay the assignment for the one resource, use the Task Form<span class="wingdings"></span> Schedule view. In the example below, 3 resources are assigned to the task “Packing boxes” which is occurs May 17-29. Mary Hill has been asked to work on another task and cannot start her part of this task until the following Monday, May 21. She will need a 2 day delay in the start of her assignment.</p>

			</ol>
			<p class="Paragraph">After entering the 2 day delay for Mary Hill, her assignment dates are May 21-31. This will result in the task taking 2 days longer and might also affect the end date for the project. Note that the delay affected the assignment of Mary Hill only and not the other resources.</p>

			<p class="Section-Heading">Max Units</p>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">The Max units column on the Resource Sheet indicates the quantity of the resource that is available to be assigned to tasks. The Max units column displays the value as either a decimal or percentage format as determined in the scheduling options for the project. The display in decimal or percentage value is a personal preference and will not affect scheduling assignments.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span><span class="strong">If Max units is 100% or 1</span>: the default assignment would be at 100% of time that is available represented on the resource calendar for the resource.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span><span class="strong">If Max units is 50% or .5</span>: the default assignment would be at 50% of time that is available represented on the resource calendar for the resource.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span><span class="strong">If Max units is 500% or 5</span>: you will have up to 5 full time resources available to assign to tasks of this type of resource.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Paragraph">When creating percentage assignments, the assignment is a request for part of the availability of a resource. If the Max Units column is less than 1 or 100%, the result will be a percent of a percentage available for a resource. Since resource names do not indicate the value of the Max Units column, assignment results might not be consistent.</p>

				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Generic resources will use the default standard calendar to schedule work, unless another calendar has been assigned to the resource. When a human resource is assigned, the task will most likely increase in length (except for Fixed duration tasks) to accommodate the availability calendar of the resource. This might result in an later scheduled project finish date.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>When assigning resources to a task using a task calendar, make sure that the option to “ignore the resource calendars” is checked. If this is not checked, the task will appear that the resources are assigned but the work values will be zero.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Fixed duration tasks are tied to dates. When an assignment is created, the resource must have availability between the dates of the task. It is always a good idea to check the assigned work for the assignment. If the resource becomes unavailable after the assignment is made, the task length will change to accommodate the assignment.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Manual v. Automatic scheduling task modes will return different assignment results. Switching from one mode to another might recalculate the work or duration of the task. Manual mode uses the duration value, resource availability and units to calculate assignments.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>When assigning work to Effort-driven tasks, the first assignment will establish the amount of work for the task.

				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Do not assign resources to summary tasks or milestones. The software allows assignments to summary tasks, but summary tasks are subtotals and not trackable. Tracking will only be correct for Summary tasks when 0% work has been performed or 100% of the detail tasks for the summary task are completed. Milestones are 0 work and 0 duration tasks. Assigning a resource changes the meaning.</li>

If assignments are created at 8 hours per day, are you are likely creating an unrealistic schedule. Many project managers will use 75% to 80% of an 8 hour day when assigning resources at 100% availability.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>If you are assigned a resource for 50% of their time, clarify how many hours of work per day 50% represents. Does 50% mean 50% of his total work time or 50% of the time the resource has available to work on projects? Try also to clarify how many hours per week the resource may be scheduled on your project.</li>

			<p class="Header">Lesson 4: Viewing Resource Assignments</p>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Once assignments are created, refining them and looking at them from different points of view is not only helpful but necessary. If resource allocations and future resource demands are your goals for using Project 2010, taking a deeper look at the results of how the assignments were created will be essential.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">In this lesson we will take a look at:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Resource Usage view</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Task Usage view</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="Section-Heading">Resource Usage View</p>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">The purpose of the Resource Usage view is to allow viewing and updating of assignments from the resource point of view. This view displays all assignments created for a resource as well as assignment details for time and cost information and enables fine tuning of assignments. Details maybe viewed at any timescale density that is appropriate for your project.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Using this view will also allow access to the Assignment information box where you can adjust the rate charts used per task and resource assignment contouring.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Some of the details available in this view will answer the following questions?</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>How much availability does a resource have? Per day, per week, etc.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>What is the cost of having a resource work on a task?</li>

			<p class="First-Paragraph">Most project manger’s work daily to make sure that all work is covered by appropriate resources that have enough time available to do the work necessary to complete a project. When resources are overbooked they are called Overallocated.</p>

			</ol>
			<p class="Section-Heading">Understanding Overallocations</p>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Each resource is assigned a calendar when entered on the Resource Sheet. The calendar is customized to contain the availability of the resource. When more work is assigned to a resource than time available on their resource calendar, the resource is considered to be overallocated. The overallocation calculation is looking at resource assignments on a minute by minute basis. If a resource is overbooked for even 1 minute, the resource is considered overallocated.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">When a resource is overallocated, a red person symbol appears in the indicator column. This indicates that there is an overallocated resource assigned to the task but will not indicate which resource is affected. Even though resources are overallocated, assignments can continue to be created.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Below is a view of tasks with overallocated resources:</p>

			<p class="Paragraph">The view below shows Mary Hill’s 100% capacity shows an indicator line. The blue bars below the line are within her 100% capacity limits. The red bars above the line represent her overallocations based on her resource calendar. Peak Units are displayed in the lower portion of the graphic.

The Resource Allocation view is a split view with the Resource Usage view on the top and the Leveling Gantt view on the bottom.

			<p class="Section-Heading">Leveling Resources Manually</p>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Project 2010 has a function called Resource Leveling that can help level the work of the resources. It is designed to move assignments forward or backward within time limits to attempt to level or smooth the workload for the resources and remove or lessen overallocations.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Automatic resource leveling in Project 2010 is designed to move resource assignments to a point in time where, based on the resource calendar, the resource has time available. If resources have a capacity of 160 hours of work available in a month and they are assigned to 200 hours of work, the project duration will extend outwards to schedule the work via resource leveling. To level resources, and keep to the original time line, either or both of the following should occur: the percentage of capacity of the resources is increased, or more resources are added. Failure to do either will result in an inability to complete some of the planned work.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Manual resource leveling should always be tried before attempting automatic leveling. Leveling is most effective when performed by a project manager who is most familiar with the work and the people.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">The following are some suggestions for effective manual resource leveling:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Add more people necessary skills to tasks</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Obtain more time from the people you already have (nights, weekends, etc)</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Outsource a portion of the work</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Negotiate deadlines to see if extensions are possible</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Move the best resources to the most critical tasks. There is less risk and greater probability of these resources completing the tasks on time.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Give a lesser skilled resource to a highly skilled resource as an assistant. This is a win-win. The highly skilled resource will give the lesser skilled resource some of the lower level work. The lesser skilled resource will learn something new. Might increase cost.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Cancel vacations</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Adjust relationships</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Break long tasks up into shorter tasks and divide the work over more resources if possible. Under-allocated resources will be better utilized</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-2">•&#9;</span>Break long tasks around fixed dates. Do some of the work before and complete the work after.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="Section-Heading">Leveling Resources Automatically</p>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Once the decision is made that leveling needs to occur, there are several ways to level resources within the software. The different options are:</p>
			<ul>
