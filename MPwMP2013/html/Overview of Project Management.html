			<h1 class="header">Project Management as a Discipline </h1>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Project management is the discipline of blending time-tested best practices, defined processes, soft skills, and the use of tools and templates, then applying these to initiatives resulting in proactive efficiency. Stakeholder satisfaction is better realized when utilizing a consistent and methodical approach to the management of projects. Also, this systematic approach paves the way for easier measurement and progress tracking of a project.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">One of the most used tools is technology to assist project managers in developing schedules capturing scope, progress and project reporting. One of the most popular technology tools is Microsoft Project (hereafter known as Project or MS Project).</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">This course will focus on use of the desktop versions of Project.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">The authors of this book have been using a wide range of scheduling technologies since the early 1990’s. MS Project has been an evolving project scheduling and planning tool and has recently in the last few years seen some significant changes all with dramatic impact in supporting Project, Program and Portfolio management.</p>

			<p class="Paragraph">It is often said that tools do not manage projects – people manage projects. In that light, it is important to remember that technology is only a tool.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">The use of Project is not the “Silver Bullet” answer to:</p>

			</ul>
			<p class="after-list-paragraph">The ability to satisfy the project requirements is the ultimate goal of project management. Satisfy the requirements and undoubtedly you will satisfy the customer. This does not mean that the deliverables will not change, but through managing customer expectations and clear communication revised requirements can be met.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">A properly managed project allows a diverse team of customers, sponsors, experts and stakeholders to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Agree on the deliverables</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Work efficiently to deliver the project on time and on budget</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Agree at the end that all requirements and specifications have been met</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="section-heading">Microsoft Project and Core Competencies</h2>
			<p class="Paragraph">To achieve these goals a project team needs more than their technical skills. High performance project teams excel at these core competencies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Planning: Build schedules with sufficient detail to enable management of activities and resources.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Milestone management: Use milestones to clarify deliverables and accountability.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Scope control: Use systems to reduce rework and manage scope controls.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Risk management: Continuously assess risks so that they are prioritized, mitigated, and communicated.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Issues management: Capture relevant issues so that they are properly prioritized and efficiently managed.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Communications: Keep sponsors, team members, customers, cross-project contacts, management, and other stakeholders informed and engaged.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 class="header">Projects Most Likely to Fail</h1>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Many times projects have significant hurdles to overcome. As a project manager or a member of a project team, you can look for the tell-tale warning signs of a project process that is not working.</p>
			<h2 class="section-heading">Major Risk Factors Leading to Project Failure</h2>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>The user’s requirements are not accurately understood, clarified, or reconciled. The project delivers a product the customer does not like or does not use.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Failure to control scope creep and added feature enhancements. Estimates show that over half of the effort expended on many projects is outside the original project scope and plan. Much of the new work is poorly documented and un-budgeted.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Technical/feature specifications change too often along the way. The project wastes time and resources doing rework.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Loss of management support. When corporate priorities shift projects may become casualties.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Team is not aligned on the same outcomes. The team fails to clearly understand what outcomes the customer is expecting and, therefore, internal confusion jeopardizes project success.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Lukewarm support from key people. Stakeholders say “yes,” but resources are not allocated and work is not properly prioritized.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Failure to have a plan with adequate details and controls. Too much time is lost coordinating details which often results in inadequate or late deliverables.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Failure to agree on how decisions are made. Decisions made by the wrong people or at the wrong time result in suboptimization, staff frustration, and rework.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Inadequate coordination between teams and between organizational/departmental silos. Results in duplications, incompatibilities and rework.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Lack of an adequate adoption and learning plan. The best product in the world fails when people are not motivated to use it, are not organizationally structured to use it, or lack the skills and know-how to use it effectively.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="after-list-paragraph">It is up to the project team, and ultimately the project manager, to watch for these common hindrances to projects and put efforts in place to counteract ill effects that can damage project success.</p>
			<h1 class="header">Overview of Project Program and Portfolio Management</h1>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Project Portfolio Management (PPM) is the integration of projects, programs and portfolios that incorporate individual initiatives and alignment of strategic business goals and objectives across the enterprise.</p>
			<h2 class="section-heading">Project Management</h2>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Project management focuses on delivering requirements to a customer. As has been said: project management is about doing projects right. In this area, Project is a powerful tool for helping project managers and Project Management Offices (PMOs) plan, track and manage projects consistently and effectively.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Project helps centralize project data, helping to ensure that there is just “one version of the truth” about any project or group of projects at any given time. It also provides a historical record of each project that can provide a solid basis for billing, financial analysis, performance evaluations, and future process improvements.</p>
			<h2 class="section-heading">Program Management</h2>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Program management is the discipline of managing a group of related projects and activities, such as a group of projects related to a particular product line (e.g., the Mars Space Program, which is all of the projects focusing on the different Mars Space missions, launch vehicles, and scientific projects related to them). There may be many programs within an organization. </p>
			<p class="Paragraph">The goal of program management is to coordinate, align and optimize projects to achieve the overall business objectives of a particular service or product area. Program management is often concerned with managing all of the resources of an organization more efficiently. A common objective of program management is the coordination of timelines to achieve larger production criteria such as deadlines, product interoperability, and economies of scale</p>
			<h2 class="section-heading">Portfolio Management</h2>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Portfolio management is about doing the right projects, aligning project selection across an entire organization or company with the organization’s global strategy. The focus is on identifying the metrics that should guide the decisions about which projects should and should not be pursued:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Organizational priorities</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Business objectives</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Strategic values</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="after-list-paragraph">In some organizations, the PMO focuses on more tactical project management process definition and controlling activities. These are critical elements in achieving project management maturity. Beyond managing projects effectively – doing projects right – how can an organization ensure they are selecting the right projects to deliver the strategic business values their company is pursuing? How do they consistently choose the right projects to carry out?</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Organizations sometimes create both a tactical PMO for projects and a strategic PMO which focuses on portfolio management priorities. This is becoming more common in organizations that have multiple tactical PMOs working on different programs in order to align all of their PMOs and programs with the overall company strategy.</p>
			<h2 class="section-heading">Rolling Up Metrics for Project-to-Portfolio Management</h2>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Project can provide critical value in a program management process by serving as the central repository for all of the projects in a program, with centrally administered planning, SharePoint Project Sites facilitate active and centrally administered document sharing and collaboration. Program and portfolio managers can use Project to create custom fields, tables, views, reports, SharePoint sites and project workspaces and templates that support and standardize their projects to support their program and portfolio criteria.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Project is designed to roll up the values of all the data into summaries at the project, group, organizational, resource, and other levels. The power of Project Professional/Project Pro for Office 365 combined with Project Server/Project Online to aggregate data from multiple projects is very valuable to any organization trying to gain visibility to the full range of their project activities.</p>
			<h2 class="section-heading">Supporting Fact-Based Decision-Making</h2>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Organizational culture tends to reinforce history and usually reflects the leadership. Organizations tend to make the same decisions the same way they always have. With some organizations this means the process is very personalistic: individual opinions and personalities are the dominant factors in project selection and management. In more mature organizations, there may be a clear, rational process for project selection, but the vision is narrow and focused on the objectives of each organization’s silo.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">The goal of portfolio management is to evaluate all projects across an organization using a standardized set of criteria which is applied to all projects, activities, and programs. These criteria, or metrics, are derived from the organizational priorities. </p>
			<p class="Paragraph">For example, these might include profitability, new market development, revenue generation, quality, safety, employee development or retention, efficiency, compliance with industry or legal standards, and so on.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Project provides a powerful set of integrated tools to support an organization’s efforts to plan, track, and analyze all of their activities. The ability to plan and track all the way down to the detailed task level and roll up all of the data to the highest organizational level gives a company lots of options for gathering business intelligence, which can then be used to make decisions based on facts and move away from the dependence on anecdotal evidence, personalities and untested opinions.</p>
			<h1 class="header">Project Lifecycle Management</h1>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Complex project management processes require tools to manage them. People tend to use what they have available, are already familiar with, and already use. This is why Microsoft Office Excel is often used in smaller project management initiatives. For many projects, Excel is sufficient.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">However, it does not take very much complexity – higher number of tasks, multiple interrelated schedules, resources, requirements, deliverables, and departments – to exceed Excel’s project management capabilities. Advanced software applications have been developed to support and facilitate many levels and styles of project management – from simple, high-level schedules to complex, integrated enterprise solutions.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Project management processes can become very multifaceted. One of the risks of complex processes is that they tend to be ignored in practice, resulting in inconsistent results, idiosyncratic management, and frustration.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Strategic project management methods and consistent project management processes need tools designed specifically to support them to be truly efficient and effective. The leading application on the market specifically designed to support project management is Project.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Project is a powerful relational database program that can be configured for use on a single client PC in any of the desktop versions. But its capabilities to facilitate and automate enterprise-wide project management processes within a networked system are limited. For organizations that are seeking an integrated, enterprise-wide project and portfolio management solution, Microsoft has developed Project Professional or Project Pro for Office 365 to integrate with Project Server or Project Online.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">As defined by the <span class="cite">A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – Fourth Edition</span>, a project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. The temporary nature of projects indicates a definite beginning and end. The end is reached when the project’s objectives have been achieved.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Project management, then, is the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">The PMBOK breaks projects into 5 Process Groups and 9 Knowledge Areas for management of a project. The 5 Process Groups are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Initiating</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Planning</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Executing</li>

			<h2 class="section-heading">Leveraging Technology for Project Management</h2>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Why use Project?</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Projects have become a strategic vehicle for leading change. Utilizing technology to support higher success rates of projects is integral for supporting this change and driving continuous improvement.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Some examples of organizational projects are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>New product and service development projects</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Process improvement projects</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Policy and organizational development projects</li>

				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Focused activities to deliver specific outcomes for clients</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="after-list-paragraph">Organizations are pursuing more and more different kinds of projects every day.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">For some organizations, projects are a small, but an important part of their business. Many organizations are projectizing their strategic work – so they can more effectively focus on key initiatives.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">For others, projects are their business. From architects, builders, engineers and construction companies to marketing teams, IT organizations, and software developers… projects define their work.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">The demand for effective, consistent project management has grown rapidly over the last decade. Project management has rapidly become a core area of management knowledge and practice. The role of a project manager has become very common in organizations.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">The question project management focuses on answering is: what are the processes that lead to successful projects?</p>
			<h2 class="section-heading">Leveraging Technology for Project Lifecycle Management</h2>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">As companies further integrate collaboration processes and culture into their organizational structure, it is necessary to consider how to utilize technological tools to ensure the stability and financial well-being of the organization. MS Project integrated with other applications such as SharePoint can assist in regulating and optimizing the duration, cost, use of human and capital resources, and affect the quality of the product or system being produced.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Most corporate objectives and initiatives are highly complex undertakings. They require a neutral system of reporting and evaluation that presents data to teams, management, and stakeholders and that allows them to react pro-actively and adjust to the inevitable changes (both positive and negative) that will occur. Recognizing MS Project is a tool that increases visibility, accountability, communication, collaboration, and as an optimization tool that will assist in better decision making by management and team members will certainly have a positive impact on the various “bottom-line” objectives and, to a greater extent, the overall organization.</p>
			<h2 class="section-heading">Different Project Lifecycle Approaches</h2>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">The project management discipline has developed into a core area of organizational management. Different industries have developed project management methodologies that address their specific workflows and issues. Architects, construction companies and property developers have developed a set of project lifecycles that reflect certain standard processes from land planning and acquisition, to permitting and design requirements. Other industries, such as software development, have developed different methodology and processes to accommodate their environment.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">The rapid growth of the project management field has spawned a number of professional associations. The Project Management Institute (PMI) is the largest global project management professional association in the world today and it is continuing to grow rapidly. The most widely used standard for project management has been developed by the PMI.</p>
			<h2 class="section-heading">PMI (Waterfall)</h2>
			<p class="Paragraph">PMI has developed a very extensive library of project management standards, references and tools. PMI has collected the most comprehensive reference on project management standards in a book called <span class="cite">The Project Management Body of Knowledge</span> – affectionately called “The PMBOK.” The PMBOK defines a certain standard for project management practices, which many industries follow.</p>

					<img class="frame-5" src="Overview-of-Project-Management-web-resources/image/69002.png" alt="69002.png" />
				</div>
				<p class="Callout-Text">Project has been developed to support a range of PMBOK-aligned project management approaches. It can be configured to support other approaches, such as Scrum and Agile, but organizations employing these methodologies need to adjust their use and expectations of Project as a scheduling and management vehicle. </p>
			</div>
			<p class="Paragraph"></p>
			<h2 class="section-heading">Technical Lifecycles (Agile Methodologies)</h2>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">There are other approaches to project management that have been developed by and for project managers in different fields and industries. Two approaches used fairly widely in the technology sector are called Scrum and Agile.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">The software development and technology industries have developed approaches to project management that reflect the need of short design-build iterations to facilitate integrating emerging requirements into new product development processes. These tend to focus on shorter iterations and progressive requirements definition.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">It might be said that where the PMBOK methodology focuses on thorough planning before project execution, Scrum and Agile focus on minimizing the time between project initiation and execution, and repeated cycles of design, build, test, redesign, rebuild, and test.</p>
			<h2 class="section-heading">Industry-Specific Lifecycles</h2>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Some industries and fields that have developed their own project management methodologies and lifecycles include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Construction</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Manufacturing</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="after-list-paragraph">MS Project is able to be configured and utilized to support many different project management processes, and is especially applicable to projects with longer life cycles.</p>
			<h1 class="header">Strategic Capability Planning</h1>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">When you create a dynamic schedule (where the tasks have dependencies and changes to tasks (duration, work, and relationships) have a ripple effect to the schedule’s date range), due to the connected and non-constrained tasks, you are able to see the impact of what if planning.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Since MS Project has the ability to have multi-level undo as well as tracing its predecessors and successors visually on the screen, you can apply changes to single or multiple schedules and review the impact of key deliverables, milestones or resource capacity to deliver the new and adjusted work.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">A common point is brought by many who haven’t used MS Project very deeply that “there is no way to create a snapshot”. This is clearly a lack of understanding as MS Project allows you to create a baseline plan which can be used to compare against the actual plan and provide variances against a point in time.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Project even allows you to capture versions of your schedule and compare them for variances.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">These features give the project scheduler the ability to broad sweeping analysis of snapshots, scenarios to review the strategic ability / capabilities of the organization to deliver.</p>
			<h1 class="header">Microsoft’s Project Management Solution</h1>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Microsoft offers a variety of software solutions that can be used to map with organizational maturity levels and desired levels of collaboration. The following graphic illustrates recommended mappings. This book focuses on the desktop versions of Microsoft Project which provide features for both basic and advanced project management.</p>

			<h2 class="section-heading">What is Project Server?</h2>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Some organizations will not only use the desktop version of MS Project, but they will centralize those schedules and resource pools in a web-based, SQL based environment that is embedded as an application in SharePoint. This is called Project Server and it provides a significant stabilization of project and resource information, while simultaneously enabling web based viewing, tracking, progressing and reporting (in SharePoint). It also has significant Business Intelligence Reporting and can be accessed via most web browsers by different stakeholders, without needing MS Project installed and without locking out the file.</p>

			<h1 class="header">PMI’s Practice Standard for Scheduling</h1>
			<p class="First-Paragraph">Due to requests by the project management community, PMI created extensions to its most popular book, the PMBOK. One of these extensions is the Practice Standard for Scheduling. This particular extension was created out of the need to provide guidelines on something that most project managers do every day – schedule. While not specific to any scheduling tool, you will be happy to know that Project does conform as a schedule model according to their Conformance Assessment Process, which means Project has all the required software components needed to function as a valid schedule tool.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">The purpose of this extension is to provide best practices for the creation of a schedule model. It is not to recommend particular software, but instead provides components that should be considered as required in your selected scheduling software. A good schedule must have both a strong scheduling framework and a baseline schedule. Each of these two areas are discussed in detail in the standard. A large portion of the standard contains a components list that you can use to help communicate with others about elements in a schedule. In terms of Project, many of these components are called fields.</p>
			<p class="Paragraph">Some of the important definitions made in the standard:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Scheduling is all about the “roadmap” of how you plan to deliver the project.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span><em>Schedule Method</em> – how you want your information calculated to generate a schedule (e.g., critical path method).</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span><em>Scheduling Tool</em> – software that is capable of applying your schedule method.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span><em>Schedule Model</em> – a scheduling tool that implements a scheduling method generates a schedule model.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-2-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>In our instance, Project uses the information you provide against the critical path method of scheduling and generates a schedule model. The schedule model is a dynamic representation of how project activities will be executed by the resources. </li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span><em>Project Schedule</em> – this is one output of the schedule model which could include a bar chart.</li>

			<p class="Paragraph">Some differences between the Practice Standard for Scheduling and this book:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Our book discusses estimating tasks with duration or work values before adding resources, while the Practice Standard adds resources before estimating tasks. You can do these items in either order in Project and still have a valid schedule.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Our book discusses task relationships/linking before assigning resources while the Practice Standard does the reverse. You can do these items in either order in Project and still have a valid schedule.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Project uses the term Status Date, while the Practice Standard uses Data Date.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>The Practice Standard states that a valid schedule model must include both a start and finish milestone which all activities must connect to. We consider this a personal choice and schedules can still be valid even if these two milestones are not present.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>The Practice Standard recommends limiting the use of lags and negative lags (leads) and instead adding extra tasks or modifying relationships. In our experience, it is your personal preference to use lags/leads or not.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="after-list-paragraph">The Practice Standard for Scheduling is available at no charge online to PMI members or available in the PMI bookstore for non-members.</p>
			<h1 class="header">Key Points to Remember</h1>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Project management can become more disciplined by applying a technology such as Project.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Your plan should be to satisfy your goals and the goals of your customer.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Use technology to support high rates of project success.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Choose the lifecycle approach that fits your industry or type of project.</li>
				<li class="bullet--level-1-"><span class="char-style-override-1">•&#9;</span>Follow the Practice Standard for Scheduling where appropriate.</li>
