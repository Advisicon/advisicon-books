This award has to be renewed annually and is extremely competitive. Tim has held this for over 10 years.</p>
			<p class="frontmatter-body">Tim has been assisting Project Management Offices and Organizations (PMO’s) in leveraging technology like Office Applications, Project, Project Server &amp; SharePoint to meet their business Intelligence and reporting needs.

As a professional project manager, Cindy has focused her career on Information Technology projects specializing in company-wide system implementations spanning industries such as architecture, financial, manufacturing, medical, education and high tech. Cindy has in-depth expertise in lifecycle management, organizational project/portfolio process development and management, and customized curriculum development and execution.</p>
			<p class="frontmatter-body">Cindy has been a sought-after consultant called on to help numerous companies both locally and across North America to deploy, assist and, if needed, rescue failed Project Server implementations. Cindy has captured complex business requirements and delivered a best in case solution recommending features that derive value for the business and provided consultative training to apply these features immediately. She has deployed Project Server, deployed Proof-of-Concept instances and has directed Project Server upgrades.

She is the second person at Advisicon to receive this award following Tim Runcie. If you haven’t seen Cindy, watch for her at the next Microsoft or PMI conference or event. Some of her past duties at these events including giving short presentations, running hands-on labs, working Project kiosks and booths, demoing software, and working at Ask the Experts’ events.</p>
