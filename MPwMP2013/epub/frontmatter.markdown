## About the Authors

### Tim Runcie, MCTS, MCP, PMP, MVP, Advisicon President

Tim Runcie, the President of Advisicon, has over 25 years of experience in 
Information Systems and 15 years in Construction Management. Tim has been 
recognized by Microsoft as an MVP (Most Valuable Professional) for his outstanding 
excellence in Office and for his support to technical communities worldwide. 
He was first recognized as an Access MVP and has continued to gain recognition 
as a Project Portfolio Manager (PPM) in Enterprise Project, Program and Portfolio 
Management MVP for his expertise in MS Project, Project Server & SharePoint. 
This award has to be renewed annually and is extremely competitive. Tim has held 
this for over 10 years.

Tim has been assisting Project Management Offices and Organizations (PMOs) in 
leveraging technology like Office Applications, Project, Project Server & 
SharePoint to meet their business Intelligence and reporting needs. His experience 
covers all sectors of customer industries such as High Tech, Government, Non-Profit, 
Private Business, Manufacturing, Construction, Banking, Healthcare and the 
Information Services or Information Technology industries.

He has focused in consulting, mentoring and training organizations to successfully 
complete their projects using scarce re-sources, fixed budgets and interconnected 
schedules, while leveraging technologies to automate and create powerful visual 
reports. Tim combines industry best practices, a passion for knowledge transfer, 
and tools development to optimize Project and Project Portfolio Management 
processes and to successfully integrate Project Management best practices into 
organizations' culture.

Tim loves teaching. When not leading or mentoring organizations, he is teaching 
classes centered on the disciplines and technologies of Project Management. To 
every project he brings a personal passion for education and a commitment to 
providing Advisicon's customers with a full set of skills and tools to achieve 
optimum success.

### Cindy M. Lewis, MCTS, MCITP, MCT, PMP, PMI-SP, MVP

Cindy is the Director of Knowledge Management at Advisicon, Inc. She brings over 
20 years of experience in scheduling, training and managing large projects. As 
a professional project manager, Cindy has focused her career on Information 
Technology projects specializing in company-wide system implementations spanning 
industries such as architecture, financial, manufacturing, medical, education 
and high tech. Cindy has in-depth expertise in lifecycle management, organizational 
project/portfolio process development and management, and customized curriculum 
development and execution.

Cindy has been a sought-after consultant called on to help numerous companies 
both locally and across North America to deploy, assist and, if needed, rescue 
failed Project Server implementations in versions 2002, 2003, 2007, 2010, 2013, 
and Project Online. In Project Server Cindy has captured complex business 
requirements and delivered a best in case solution recommending features that 
derive value for the business and provided consultative training to apply these 
features immediately. She has deployed Project Server, deployed Proof-of-Concept 
instances and has directed Project Server upgrades. Her vast experience includes 
working with both on-site and cloud based (hosted) solutions.

Her passion is training and leading large groups via both live and virtual
classrooms. Courses are delivered several times a month onsite at customer
training facilities.

Cindy received the Most Valuable Professional (MVP) award in Project by
Microsoft in 2012 and 2013. With an estimate of less than 60 people receiving
this designation for Project out of the thousands of MVPs awarded worldwide,
this is a great testament to her dedication to the scheduling community.
She is the second person at Advisicon to receive this award following Tim
Runcie. If you haven't seen Cindy, watch for her at the next Microsoft or PMI
conference or event. Some of her past duties at these events included giving
presentations, staffing hands-on labs, working Project kiosks and booths,
