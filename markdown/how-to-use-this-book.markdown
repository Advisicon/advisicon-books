This book uses a few conventions to display meaning within the text.

**Bold text** indicates the title of a button, menu item, or file name, that 
should be clicked on or selected to complete a step. Bold text also indicates 
a key word or phrase worthy of consideration.

Text that is set in a `monospace font` indicates text that needs to be typed in 
(like a URL, or code).
