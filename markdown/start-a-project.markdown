## Overview

New schedules can be created a number of ways: importing a task list, applying
a template, or pulling data from Excel or SharePoint. Common tasks in managing
existing schedule files include opening, saving, and exporting data. Project
has many time-saving features that can be applied to help meet the needs of
individuals who integrate with SharePoint or Excel. 

After a schedule is up and running, next steps typically include configuring
the standard calendar and setting project options (which may encompass Project
globally or may apply only to an individual schedule). Scheduling options could
have a dramatic impact on how tasks are calculated and those options should be
evaluated before building a schedule.  

## Creating New Projects

One of the very first things you need to do to create a project is to choose an
approach. 

There are several methods to select from when creating a new schedule using
Microsoft Project 2013. You may start a project schedule with a blank template
or use an existing template. If you have a task list started in Excel, Outlook,
Word and SharePoint, these task lists may be added to a new project schedule.
Below are some of the suggested methods for initiating a new project schedule.

* Blank -- clean schedule
* New From Existing -- copy from existing schedule
* New From Excel -- importing information from Excel
* New From SharePoint Tasks List -- shortcut to bring SharePoint tasks into your 
  schedule
* Get Started Wizard -- guided approach with visuals to help individuals feel 
  more comfortable working in a schedule
* Template -- public or private pre-built schedules that can be used as examples

<aside class="note callout">
**Note**: If you do not have Internet access, you may not have all of these
choices. Many templates are available from the Microsoft site and are not
included with the software when installed.
</aside>

<aside class="note callout">
**Note**: Office 365 or cloud users may have different choices depending on
their organization's configuration.
</aside>

To start a new project schedule:

1. Click the **File** tab.
2. Click **New**.
3. Click the desired item from the previews.
4. If needed, click **Create** to obtain a copy of that item to start your schedule.

<aside class="note callout">
**Note**: Templates available are simply examples and may not map to your
organization's project management practices. Be sure to review the templates
for modifications that you might need to make.

## Saving a project

Saving a project is all about storing a project for quick and easy retrieval.
You may choose to store your project on your computer, on a network location,
or on a cloud storage solution. As each organization's configuration is
different, we will focus on the procedures for saving to your local computer. 

To save a new project:

1. Click the **File** tab.
2. Click **Save** or **Save As**.
3. Click **Computer**.
4. Click **Browse**.
5. Navigate to the desired folder.
6. Enter the desired name for the schedule.
7. Click **Save**.

<aside class="tip callout">
**Tip**: The folder you just used will be available under **Open**,
**Computer** to simplify this process for future new projects.
</aside>

<aside class="tip callout">
**Tip**: When making changes to the same project, you can use the **Save** icon
on the Quick Access Toolbar as a fast method to ensure your project changes are
being captures.
</aside>

### Save or Save As, Share and Export

When saving, there are different techniques that can be applied depending on
whether the information is being saved for future use in Project or whether it
will be used in another program such as Excel or SharePoint. The Save As option
is also useful when a copy of the schedule is required for running a scenario
or making a backup. 

### Saving the Schedule

Project 2013 provides multiple file formats for a project schedule. The steps
to save a file are very similar to other Microsoft Office files.

To save the Project 2013 schedule:

1. Click **File** &rarr; **Save as** &rarr; select file location
2. Enter the file name in the File Name area
3. Click **Save** to complete the save. The file will be given a Project 2013 
   default file extension of .mpp

There is also an option to save the Project 2013 schedule in an alternative
file format. Some of the formats are:

* Microsoft Project 2007
* Microsoft Project 2000-2003
* Microsoft Project template 2013 (*.mpt)
* Microsoft Project template 2007 (*.mpt)
* Microsoft Excel
* PDF Files (*.pdf)
* XPS Files (*.xps)
* XML Format (*.xml)
* CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)
* Text (Tab Delimited) (*.txt)
* Excel Workbook (*.slsx)
* Excel Binary Workbook (*.slsb)
* Excel 97-2003 (.xls)

#### Save As

The Save As view, located in the backstage area in Project 2013, has been
enhanced and provides more functionality for the user. From the backstage view
these options are an easy method of saving projects to disk as well as sharing
projects schedules with others users. Options have been added to sync a project
with a Sharepoint site and to save a project to a Skydrive site. 

To navigate to the options available for Save As:

Click **File** &rarr; **Save As** &rarr; select one of the options offered

<aside class="note callout">
**Note**: The right side of the screen will change as options are selected.

![View for selecting how to create a new project.](../assets/available\ templates.png)

### Creating a Project from an Excel Workbook

A project schedule can be created using an Excel Workbook task list. Keep in mind that the fields or columns that are being imported from Excel will be mapped to fields or columns within Project 2013. Pre-planning to know which Excel fields should be mapped to which Project 2013 fields would be helpful.
To create a project schedule from an Excel Workbook:
Click File &rarr; New &rarr; New From Excel Workbook.
Navigate to the Excel file that contains the tasks to be imported into the schedule, click Open.
Project 2013 Import Wizard will start running -- Click Next.
Select whether to use a new map that will be created or an existing Project import map. For this example we will create a new map. Click the radio button next to New Map and click Next.
Import can start a new project file, append to the end of an existing project file or merge the data using a merge field. In this example we will create a new project schedule. Click As a new project and click Next.
When the data is brought into Project 2013, select if the data is to be mapped to the Task fields, Resource fields or Assignment fields. Click Tasks.
If the originating Excel file contains header or title information, click Import includes Headers. The system will remove this row (the first line only) as the header row. Click Next.
The Task Mapping form will be used to view some of the data and map which Excel fields will be imported into which Project 2013 fields. Pull down the values in the Select worksheet name option and select the sheet name in Excel that contains the data to be imported. After the choice has been made, the data from the sheet will be available for viewing.
In the example below, the duration field from the Excel Workbook was able to be automatically mapped to the duration field in Project 2013. However, the Task Name field could not find a match. The correct field name for the task name field in Project 2013 is "Name". Click the red error message (not mapped) and select the field name of Name. Repeat for other fields to be imported. Not all fields are required during the import process which allows the user to pick and choose which ones are appropriate to the schedule. Click Next to continue after all columns have been mapped.

Mapping that is created in the Import Wizard.
The next step offers the option to save the map for future use.
To skip saving the map, click Next.
To save the map, click Save Map and give the map a name.
Click Finish to start the import.
The new Project 2013 schedule will open with the columns imported.
Creating a Project from a SharePoint Task List
Project 2013 Professional allows for creating a new project by importing a task list from a SharePoint site. The user must have appropriate permissions to the access the SharePoint site and the URL path to insert into the form directing Project 2013 Pro to the location of the task list.
To import tasks from a SharePoint task list into Project 2013 Professional:
Click File &rarr; New &rarr; New from SharePoint Task List.

Enter the URL for the existing SharePoint site that contains a task list to import into the open project schedule.
Enter the URL in the form as shown above and click Change to Check Address. A list of all the task lists included in the SharePoint site will be displayed. Select the appropriate list and click OK.
The list will be imported from the SharePoint site.

Calendar Overview
Calendars in Project 2013 will determine when a task may be scheduled within the project schedule. It will also influence what defines a day, a week and a month within the project schedule. The calendars will also work hand-in-hand with the calendar options to determine when and how the tasks will be scheduled. Having the correct calendar applied to the project schedule before tasks are entered is essential for project scheduling success.
We will explore:
How calendars work in Project 2013
How to Set Working Hours and Days
How to Set Non-Working Hours and Days
How to Set Calendar Options
How Calendars Work in Project 2013?
There are several types of calendars within the Project 2013 system. The following are definitions of available calendars:
Project Calendar: The project calendar is the calendar assigned to a project and it defines the project working and non-working days. The default name for the Project Calendar is "Standard".
Resource Calendar: Each resource will have its own calendar which may be based off of a base calendar or the project calendar. Unique resource calendars may also be created.
Task Calendar: A task calendar is assigned to a task to allow for the scheduling of that task in a unique timeframe. For example: tasks which have to occur on a weekend.

When a project schedule is created, a default calendar of "Standard" is applied to the schedule. This is called the Project Calendar for the project. The default values on the Standard calendar are: Monday through Friday which are working days, and working time is 8:00 am to 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm daily. No holidays are indicated on the calendar. The Standard calendar is also the calendar that will be viewed in the background of the Gantt Chart view. The Calendar Options work hand in hand with the Project Calendar to determine number of hours in a day or week and these values should be in sync with one another. The Calendar options will be discussed in the next section.
By default, 2 additional calendars are included with MS Project 2013: a 24 hour calendar and a Night Shift calendar. Either of these may be used as Project, Resource or Task calendars.
FAQ's
Q: Why are there no holidays on the calendars?
A: This is an international program. Holidays vary from country to country.
Q: Is there the ability to add holidays to a calendar the way they can be added in Outlook?
A: No -- this is not a capability of the software.
Q: Do I have to recreate the calendar for each project?
A: No -- calendars may be created and saved through the Organizer to be used in future projects. The Organizer will be covered later in this chapter.

Setting Working Hours and Days
After the project file has been created, decide what the working days (business days) of the project schedule will be. Decide also, how many hours will make up a working day and what times the hours will be. By default, the working days of the calendar are Monday through Friday and the working time is 8:00 am to 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm daily or 8 hours working per day.
To Change the Working Hours of all Days on a Calendar:
Click Project &rarr; Change Working Time
Check to ensure the calendar you wish to change is displayed in the For calendar list
Click Work Weeks near the bottom of the dialogue box

Change working time box used to change the working time of a selected calendar.
After clicking on the Work Weeks tab, the word Default should be highlighted. Click the Details button to the right of the dialog box.
Click Monday, press and hold the shift key and click on Friday. All of the working days will be selected.
Click the 3rd radio button, Set day(s) to these specific working times.
You will see the standard working times. Make changes to reflect the new values.
Click Enter or Tab to move away from the value you have changed.
Click OK to close the dialog box.

Change the time details of a selected day or group of days.

Setting Non-Working Hours and Days
Non-working time is defined in the MS Project 2013 as days where work will not be planned or performed. Examples are: national and organizational holidays, training days, company shut-downs, summer hours, etc. Adding these non-working days and times to the project calendar will prevent tasks being scheduled on these non-working days.
To create a non-working day for a calendar:
Click Project &rarr; Change Working Time
Check to ensure sure that the calendar you wish to change is displayed in the For Calendar field
Click Exceptions tab near the bottom of the dialogue box

The Exceptions list is used to enter holidays or days that will be non-working days for the project.
In this example, we will set May 23, 2016 as a non-working day. Move the slider on the right side of the calendar down until April 2016 is displayed in the calendar
Click May 23, 2016
Click in the name field and enter a reason for the non-working day, i.e.: Company holiday
Click Enter
Repeat for additional non-working days. See the result below

Change the working hours and days.
To Create a Recurring Non-working Day for a Calendar:
Click Project &rarr; Change Working Time
Check to make sure that the calendar you wish to change is showing in the For calendar field
Click the Exceptions tab near the bottom of the dialog box
In this example, we will set January 1 (New Year's Day) as a recurring non-working day. Move the slider on the right side of the calendar down until January 2017 is displayed on the calendar
Click January 1, 2017
Click in the first open line in the Name field and enter New Year's Day for the non-working day
Click Enter
Click on the words New Year's Day and then click on the Details button to the right of the form
Click Yearly
Click on January 1
Enter the start date
Enter a recurrence value or an End by date
Click OK to close box
Check for the recurrence values in the Exceptions line for New Year's Day.

Recurring holiday values on calendar.
Setting Calendar Options
The Calendar options work hand in hand with the project calendar to determine how tasks will be scheduled. It is imperative that the calendar options match the project calendar to create a consistency in the scheduling values for tasks and assignment values.
To access the Calendar options:
Click File &rarr; Options &rarr; Schedule

Calendar options should be adjusted if the calendar times are changed.
What the options mean:
Calendar options for this project: option to select whether your choices for the calendar will be held within an individual project or if they will be applied to all new projects.
Week starts on: this choice will affect what is assigned and viewed as the first day of the week. The day chosen will be reflected on the Gantt Chart, Resource Usage, Task Usage and other calendar views.
Fiscal Year starts in: if using this option, select which month will be the start of the fiscal year.
Default start and end times: these values should match the time values on the project calendar. Assigning the project calendar will be discussed in the next lesson. The times stated here will be used to schedule tasks when time is not specified for a task. It will also be used to schedule tasks that do not use relationships. For example: if recurring tasks are created, the tasks will always be scheduled at the start time represented in this option.
Hours per day: when 1 day of work is scheduled, how many hours should 1 day consist of?
Hours per week: when 1 week of work is scheduled, how many hours should 1 week consist of?
Days per month: when 1 month of work is scheduled, how many days should 1 month consist of?
Saving the Calendar
In Project 2013, the calendar that was just created is known as a "custom object". Custom objects may be saved for use in the project the object was created in and used in other projects as well. To save objects the Organizer is used. When Project 2013 was installed on your system, a file named Global.mpt was created. The Organizer is the function that will copy objects into the Global.mpt as well as between project schedules. Calendars are only one of many object types that may be customized and saved for use in other project schedules. 
To save the customized calendar, the object must be copied using the Organizer.
To copy a New Base Calendar into the Global.mpt:
Click File &rarr; Info &rarr; Organizer
Click the Calendars tab
Click Standard to the right and click <<Copy
An error message will appear: "Do you want to replace the Standard in 'Global.mpt' with the Standard from '<project name.' Indicate "Yes."
Click Cancel to close the box

Use the Organizer to copy the updated calendar into your local Global.mpt file.
The Calendar will be copied into your local Global.mpt.
Project Information
The project information that should be entered before proceeding with project schedule development is the project start or project finish date as well as indicating which calendar will be used as the project calendar. This information is entered through the Project Information box.
To navigate to the Project Information dialog box:
Click Project &rarr; Project Information
Deciding whether to enter the Project Start date or the Project Finish date will take some consideration. There are pros and cons to either choice:
FAQ: Should I enter a project start and finish date?
Answer: Project 2013 will accept either the start or the finish date but not both.
Entering a start date will indicate that you are planning your schedule as forward scheduling. This will result in:
All tasks will be scheduled As soon as possible
The work of the project will determine the project ending date
You will have a date to manage your project to, and know when you are on time or late with the progress of the project
Entering a finish date will indicate that you are planning your schedule as backward scheduling. This will result in:
All tasks will be scheduled As late as possible
The ending date of the project will be locked to a date on the calendar
You might be planning a project where each task will be required to be completed as planned to achieve the ending date goals.
The most used planning method is that projects are planned from the project start date.
Project Calendar: The default calendar is "Standard". Whatever calendar is selected will become the scheduling calendar for the project. All tasks will be scheduled using this calendar until a resource is assigned to the task.
Click OK to close the box.

Project Information box.

Options
The last action you should perform before entering your first task is to set some of the options to match the requirements of your project.
Options are flexible in that they can be applied per unique project or to all new projects created on your computer. In this section we will discuss the options that will affect scheduling. These options are in addition to the calendar options discussed earlier in this chapter.
General vs Per Project Options
General options are options which affect how the installation of Project 2013 on a desktop will operate. Per Project options are options that will apply to a unique project. You may optionally apply the per project options to all new projects.
Display options are options that will help the user interact with Project 2013 software. The options selected are unique to each user and are a personal preference. These options do not have an influence on the ability to create a project schedule.
To navigate to General options:
Click File &rarr; Options &rarr; General
In the Project view section, the user may select the default view for usage of Project 2013 and the date format for dates for reports and views (table portion of a view).

General Options view.
To navigate to Display options:
Click File &rarr; Options &rarr; Display
These options refer to which elements should be viewed on the screen. These options will control which indicators are shown in the indicator column, currency values and if the Entry bar is visible or not.

Display options view.
Additional display options are available at:
Click File &rarr; Options &rarr; Advanced
Some of the options that should be considered are:
Show this number of recent documents -- optional number, list will show in the Recent tab in the backstage
Automatically add new views, tables, filters and groups to the global - recommended
Settings for duration label values -- Minutes, Days, etc. - may alter as needed
Show project summary task -- recommended

These display options are in the Advanced options section.

To turn on the Project Summary task:
Click Task &rarr; Gantt Chart
Click Format &rarr; Project Summary Task (on the right side of the ribbon)
Scheduling Options
To understand the Scheduling options it would be helpful to review some of the scheduling terms the options are referring to. 
Project's scheduling engine uses the terms "Duration" and "Work" which are fundamental to understanding project scheduling. 
Definitions
Duration: 
Is a length of time i.e.: a day, a week, or a month
It is the amount of actual time that will pass before a task is completed
Work: 
Is the quantity of work that occurs i.e.: 8 hours in one day, 40 hours in a week
It is the amount of work (effort or man hours) which a resource(s) will work to complete the task

Effort-driven scheduling
Tasks have the option of being scheduled using Effort-driven scheduling. Effort-driven scheduling is defined as when more workers are added to a task, the effort (or work) will be divided across the workers. 
For example: A project has a task called "Moving Boxes". The work of the task is to move 100 boxes from location A to B. If one person moves the boxes, it will take 10 hours of duration moving 10 boxes per hour. However, if 2 people move the boxes it will take 5 hours, 3 people can accomplish this task in one-third of the original time, etc. 
With effort-driven scheduling the duration of the task will shorten when more workers are added because the work is divided over the resources. 
Understanding Task Types
Each task will be assigned a task type when the task is added to the schedule. Task types work hand-in-hand with the effort-driven option discussed above. Task types will determine how a task is scheduled and will have an effect on the assignment of the resources to the task. Task types are considered unique per task and may be set on a task by task basis. 
The option setting is to establish the default task type you would like each task to acquire when it is entered. Task types may be changed to match the needs of the tasks at a later point in time. 
Project 2013 allows for the following 3 task types: 
Fixed Duration: A fixed duration task is a task created with a fixed length of time. Fixed Duration tasks are also tied to dates.
Example: This training class. When the time scheduled for this class is over, the work of the class is completed. 
Fixed Units: Units means quantity of a resource. Fixed Units means that the resource assignment quantity is fixed for the task. Using this task type will result in the quantity of the units assigned to a task coupled with the availability of the resource to determine the scheduling of the task. 
Example: If you assign a resource to a 5 day, 40 hour task at 100% of their effort the task will be completed in 5 days working 8 hours per day. If you assign a resource to the same task with 50% of their effort, the task will be worked 4 hours per day and will be scheduled for 10 days of duration. The 100% and 50% are the resource units. 
Fixed Work: The work of the task is fixed. Fixed work tasks, by default, are also effort-driven. The more resources assigned to the task, the less time the task will take to be complete. Fixed work tasks will be scheduled based on the quantity of the units of the resources assigned to the task and their availability based on their resource calendar. 
Example: If a task called "Plan event" will take 80 hours of work to complete, the work will be completed in 2 weeks with 1 full time resource. If a second resource is added full time, the task will be completed in 1 week dividing the work between the 2 resources. Each resource would have performed 50% of the work. As resources are added to the task, the duration of the task is reduced. 
Task type, Effort-driven combinations
When task types are coupled with the effort-driven option, the scheduling engine allows for the following task type, effort-driven combinations:

Schedules can be saved into alternate formats including PDF, older versions of Project and Excel formats. 
The Project calendar is where corporate holidays are recorded. These holidays become non-working days in the schedule.
Calendar options can be refined to tailor the Gantt Chart view or to better match the corporate working hours.
Project information is where you set the scheduling mode and date the schedule calculates from.
Within Project Options, general options apply to every schedule while per project options apply to only a specific schedule.
Duration is the length of time for a task while Work is the hours for a task.
Effort-driven scheduling means that work will be distributed across resources.
 A combination of task type and effort-driven settings may be used to achieve the desired task scheduling.
