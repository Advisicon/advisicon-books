## Overview {#printing-and-reporting-overview}

The output from a schedule is important as a communication tool; therefore
tailoring the view can be helpful to address the information needs of the
audience. Views can be customized by formatting text, formatting bars, applying
quick styles, and altering the general layout of the page. Printouts can be in
Project file format, in PDF format, or image format. These options help you
communicate with Project and non-Project users. 

Besides a traditional view, reports can be created to communicate with others.
Three popular report categories include Visual reports, Dashboard reports, and
Timeline view reports. A Visual report exports information into Visio or Excel
for further manipulation. A Dashboard report creates a visual output with
blocks or sections of information such as graphs or tables. Dashboards may
continue through multiple pages. A Timeline view report is designed for
communication information at a high-level and it is easily transferred to
other programs such as Word or Outlook. As you work with the individuals
involved in your schedule, you will be able to determine the best output
based on their needs. 

## Printing

Most of the print settings in Project 2013 are similar to other Microsoft
Office products. Unique to Project 2013 is the ability to include project and
task data in report titles using the header and footer options. We will also
discuss printing Gantt charts on paper or using Gantt charts in presentations.

In this lesson, we will discuss:

* Print Settings
* Page Setup Options
* Copy Picture

### Print Settings

Project 2013 gives you the ability to customize how a report will be printed.
Seeing the final report before it is printed assures the user that they are
printing the correct report in the format needed. Print options allow the user
to select a printer and fine-tune which data will be printed. When the print
options are selected, the current active project view will be printed.

To display print options :

* File &rarr; Print

To close print options:

* Click any tab above the ribbon bar

In the following table, Gantt Chart is the active view. On the left side of the
screen, several options are available:

## Page Setup Options

Page setup options are similar to options available in other Microsoft Office
products. Project 2013 has some unique options specifically for the types of
views available in the application. These unique options will be discussed in
this lesson.

Project level data may be entered for project name, author, company, etc. and
applied to the project header and footer information. This information is
entered using the Advanced Properties dialog box. Once the data has been
entered, the header and footer information is configured per report using the
Page Setup options.

To add information in the Advanced Properties dialog box:

* File &rarr; Info &rarr; Project Information &rarr; Advanced Properties

The dialog box is shown below:

![Advanced Properties box.](../assets/12-5-Advanced-Properties-box.png)

To display the Page Setup dialog box:

* File &rarr; Print &rarr; Page Setup

A dialog box will appear with the Page tab displayed. The options on this tab
are similar to other Microsoft Office applications. The Margin tab contains the
margin settings for the current report and an option to print borders around
the data. Adjust these values as needed. The Header and Footer tabs allow for
configuration of titles and footer information for reports. The view below
shows the Header tab used for adding the project title values.

To add Header or Footer information to the title of a project:

* Click the **Header** or **Footer** tab.
* Click on the **Left**, **Center**, or **Right** tab in the lower section of 
  the box.
* Click the down arrow to view the General drop-down menu.
* Select field value.
* Click **Add**.
* Repeat for additional data.

<aside class="tip callout">
**Tip**: The Header and Footer settings are unique per report and should be
checked using Print Preview before each reported is printed.
</aside>

<aside class="tip callout">
**Tip**: A current date is not preset to show in either the header or the
footer title lines. Add the system’s date using the center button above the
General drop-down menu.
</aside>

![View of the Header tab in the Page Setup box.](../assets/12-6-Header-view.png)

The Legend tab is used to customize or turn off the legend printed on Gantt
charts. If unique Gantt chart formatting has been created, the alternate color
coding will automatically appear in the legend when the Gantt chart is printed.
The Legend Labels button allows for font color and font selection changes. To
disable the legend printed on Gantt charts, select None on the right side of
the dialog box.

![Page Setup box viewing the Legend tab.](../assets/12-7-Legend-option.png)

The View tab contains options for specific views, but not all options will be
available for each report. The options on the View tab are:

: Options available for Printing reports on the View tab of the Print Preview box

### Copy Picture

Use the Copy Picture tool to take a picture of your active view and store it on
the clipboard. After it is stored, it can be pasted into PowerPoint, Word,
Excel or any other application. 

To use the Copy Picture tool, the view must be displayed and refined for the
picture. Navigate to the view to be copied. Some adjustments to a view might
include:

* Expand or collapse the work breakdown structure.
* Adjust timescale.
* Adjust titles in the timescale.
* Change formatting.
* Highlight tasks.
* Add drawing elements.

![Copy Picture.](../assets/Copy-Picture.png)

To use the Copy Picture tool:

* Click **Task** &rarr; down arrow to the right of the Copy Button &rarr; 
  **Copy Picture**.

If printing a Gantt chart, adjust the vertical bar in the middle to show the
columns to be included and click Copy Picture to open the Copy Picture dialog
box shown below.

* **Render image** - select image to render For Screen, For Printer or To GIF 
  image file.
* **Copy** - rows on screen or Selected rows.
* **Timescale** - as shown on the screen or date range.
* Click **OK** to copy to the clipboard.

![Copy Picture options box.](../assets/12-11-Copy-Picture.png)

Use the image to paste into a Powerpoint presentation, a Word document, an
email or other application. After pasting, resize the image as necessary.

## Save as Project file in .PDF format

In Project 2013, we have the option to save project files as PDFs. Access to
the option is located in the backstage view: 

To create a .PDF file from the current view: 

* File &rarr; Export &rarr; Create PDF/XPS Document &rarr; Create PDF/XPS

You will then be asked to select a location for the completed file. .PDF will
be the default file type. Click on this value to change to .XPS files if
necessary. 

Click OK

![Export file image as .PDF options.](../assets/Save-as-.PDF.png)

You will then be given Document Export options to make some adjustments to the
image:

* Publish Range: All or date range
* Include Non-Printing Information: Document Properties and Document Showing 
  Markup
* PDF Options: ISO 19005-1 compliant (PDF/A)

Click OK to complete creating the .PDF image. 

![Create .PDF, Document export options.](../assets/Save-as-PDF-Document-Export-Options.png)

<aside class="warning callout">
**Warning**: The Save As PDF function is limited to a single-pane view (i.e.
without a split). If you have Gantt Chart with Timeline view dis-played, the
PDF will generate based on the currently selected (active) pane. This will be
either Gantt Chart or Timeline, not both.
</aside>

## Email a Project file as an Attachment

Another way to communicate project information is to email a copy of a project
file to someone. The person who receives the file must have Microsoft Project
2010 or Microsoft Project 2013 to open the file. 

To attach the open project file to an email: 

File &rarr; Share &rarr; Email &rarr; Send as Attachment

![Share options in the backstage.](../assets/Email-as-attachment.png)

After clicking "Send as Attachment" Outlook will start, an email will be
opened, the subject line will contain the name of the project and the file will
be an attachment. Simply enter who the email should be sent to and add your
comments. Click Send when you are ready to send the message. 

![Project file as an attachment in an email.](../assets/Email-in-Outook.png)

## Refining Gantt Chart Formatting

The Gantt chart view may be altered as necessary to show the Gantt chart as
needed for reports. Changes may be made to formatting, the time scale and data
which is shown on the chart. In this section we will discuss these functions.

### Using the Format Tab

The Format tab buttons help you customize the text, columns, colors, and other
elements of each type of view. The groups and buttons in the Format tab are
different for each type of view. If you are viewing a Gantt chart view you will
receive a different set of options than you would if you were viewing the
Resource Usage view. Below is a view of the Format ribbon when the Gantt chart
view is displayed. The next two ribbon examples are the Format ribbon when
viewing the Resource Usage view and the Team Planner view. 

![Project Ribbon -- Gantt Chart Format Tab.](../assets/12-12-Format-ribbon.png)

![Project Ribbon -- Resource Usage Format ribbon.](../assets/12-13-Project-Ribbon---Resource-Usage-Format-Tab.png)

![Project Ribbon -- Team Planner Format tab.](../assets/12-14-Team-Planner-format-tab.png)

Any Gantt chart may have changes made which will enhance the message you are
trying to convey. For example, you can add the baseline or slack to the Gantt
view. Right clicking on a Gantt bar and selecting Format Bar will allow you to
change the color of a specific bar to quickly highlight specific tasks, or
perhaps you want to add text to specific bars to help you identify them. Any
changes that are made to a view will be held in the view and will be remembered
the next time the view is displayed in the file. 

<aside class="warning callout">
**Warning**: Any changes you make to one Gantt Chart view do not change the
look of other Gantt Chart views. For example, if you apply formatting to the
Gantt Chart view, this will not carry over to the Detail Gantt view.
</aside>

### Formatting Text Styles

You can use text styles to change the format of text for one cell in a table or
apply a unique format to an entire category of information, such as all
critical tasks or all Milestone tasks. You may also want to change text to be
more readable or to look distinct to garner attention for certain tasks.

<aside class="note callout">
**Note**: You can format the text the same way for any view.
</aside>

<aside class="note callout">
**Note**: You can’t format fonts in the Calendar view, but you can format
categories of text, so text will have distinct formatting for items such as all
critical tasks or all summary tasks.
</aside>

#### Formatting Selected Text

To format selected text:

 1. Select the cell(s) containing text that you want to format.

 2. In the Ribbon, **Task** tab, **Font** group, click on the desired options 
    or click on the dialog box launcher to display the **Font** dialog box. 

    ![Text Styles Dialog.](../assets/Font-dialog-box.png)

 3. From the three lists across the top of the dialog box you can select Font
    type, Font style and/or the Font Size. You can also select an Underline or
    Strikethrough check box and set the Font color, Background color and/or
    choose a Background pattern. A preview of your selection will appear in the
    sample area.

 4. Click **OK** to save changes.

#### Formatting Categories of Text

To format categories of text:

 1. In the Ribbon, **Format** tab, **Format** group click on **Text Styles**.

 2. Click the drop-down arrow next to **Item to Change:** select a category 
    of text.

    ![Text Styles Dialog with Items to Change Menu.](../assets/12-16-Text-styles-category.png)

 3. Select the settings that you want for the text, including font, font style,
    font size, color and script.

 4. Click **OK** to apply the formatting.

   <aside class="tip callout">
   **Tip**: Text Style formatting will only be applied to the view displayed
   when it is applied. It will not appear in other views. If the file is saved,
   the formatting will stay with the view.
   </aside>

### Formatting the Gantt Chart

In addition to text styles you can format the task bars. You can make changes
to the shape, color, and pattern, as well as style of the bar.

#### Changing the Gantt Bars Quickly Using a Style

With a single click, you can apply a pre-defined style to all bars in a Gantt
Chart view.

To apply pre-defined styles to Gantt bars:

 1. Apply a Gantt Chart view.

 2. In the **Format** tab, **Gantt Chart Style** group, click a style in the
    **Gantt Chart Style** group.

    ![Gantt Chart Styles Group.](../assets/12-17-Gantt-Chart-Style-group.png)

 3. The style is instantly applied to all the bars in the view.

#### Changing the Color, Shape, or Pattern of Gantt Bars

To call attention to task bars in Gantt Chart view, you can change the color,
shape, or pattern of individual task bars to separate them from other types of
bars. This technique can be used to draw attention to task bars like milestones
or summary tasks. Making changes using the Bar Styles box will change only the
current view. All bars in the view such as Gantt bars, summaries or milestones
will be affected by this change. 

To format categories of task bars:

 1. Apply a Gantt Chart view.

 2. In the **Format** tab **Bar Styles** group, click the **Format** drop-down 
    arrow, and click **Bar Styles**.

    <aside class="note callout">
    **Note**: You can also double click within the chart portion of Gantt Chart
    view, but not on individual bars, to open the Bar Styles dialog box.
    </aside>

 3. In the **Name** field, click the type of bar (such as Task or Progress) 
    that you want to format.

 4. Click the **Bars** tab at the bottom of the box.

    ![Bar Styles Dialog.](../assets/12-18-Bar-styles-dialog-box.png)

 5. Under Start, Middle, and End, click the shapes, types or patterns, and
    colors for the bar.

    ![Bottom Pane of Bar Styles Dialog -- Bars Tab Selected.](../assets/12-19-Bottom-pane-of-bar-styles.png)

 6. Click **OK** to save changes. 

    <aside class="note callout">
    **Note**: To highlight a single Gantt bar by changing its formatting, right
    click on the individual bar and select **Format Bar**.
    </aside>

#### Changing the Appearance of Link Lines Between Gantt Bars

When you link tasks, Project displays link lines on a Gantt Chart view that
show the dependency of the linked tasks.

![Link Line.](../assets/link-line.png)

You can change the way link lines appear or hide the link lines.

To change the appearance of links between Gantt bars:

 1. Apply a Gantt Chart view.

 2. In the **Format** tab, **Format** group, click **Layout**.

    ![Format Tab, Format Section, Layout button.](../assets/12-25-Format-ribbon-Format-section.png)

 3. Under **Links**, click the type of link line that you want to use. If you 
    choose the first type of link, then the link lines will not appear.

Layout box options: 

* **Links** -- used to change the look of the link lines or turn them off.
* **Date format** -- used to change the date format on the Gantt chart and 
  will not affect the date shown in the tables.
* **Bar Height** -- used to adjust the Gantt bars.
* **Always roll up Gantt bars** -- used to roll up the Gantt bars when the 
  outline level is collapsed, roll up the Gantt bars (example of rolled up 
  bars is shown below).
* **Round bars to whole days** -- used to make very short tasks more visible. 
* **Show bar splits** -- used when you have split tasks. Split tasks will also 
  appear during tracking.
* **Show drawings** -- drawing tools are located on the Format tab. Text boxes 
  and arrows may be drawn on Gantt charts. Use this option to hide the 
  drawings when needed.

## Reporting

Communication is an essential part of project management.  Project 2013
provides an abun-dance of textural and graphic reporting options to fulfill the
communication requirements needed to help you manage your projects and
communicate status to stakeholders.  

In this lesson we will discuss: 

* Visual reports
* Dashboard reports
* Timeline report

### Visual Reports

Visual reports are graphical type reports that are available in Project 2013.
These reports are defined using a template in Project 2013 and use either a
Visio PivotDiagram or Excel PivotTable technology to generate the final report.
Once a report is generated, changes and fine-tuning of the report can be
performed through Visio or Excel.

Since Visual Reports use Pivot table technology, knowledge of Pivot tables is
helpful for the project manager to gain the greatest benefit from these
reports.

In this lesson we will discuss:

* Overview of Visual Reports
* The Anatomy of Pivot Tables
* Viewing a Visual Report
* Creating a Visual Report template

#### Overview of Visual Reports

Visual Reports are reports based on dimensions and measures that produce graphs
using Pivot Tables. Pivot Tables will be discussed in the next lesson. When a
Visual Report is run, an On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP) cube of data is
built based on the metrics stated in the specifications for the Visual Report.
After the cube is built, Project 2013 connects to either Visio or Excel to
display the report. If an Excel-based report is selected, the report will be
based on Pivot Tables. If a Visio-based report is selected, a Visio Pivot
Diagram will be produced.

Once a report is generated, it can be manipulated as a Pivot Table and tailored
to fit your needs. Types of manipulations include expanding and contracting
outline levels, changing field values, selecting options, adding totals and
changing the appearance of graphs. After the Visual Reports are generated, they
can be saved or published to a reporting website.

Project 2013 provides multiple Visual Report definition templates found in the
Visual Reports - Create Report dialog box. Options are available to filter the
Excel templates from the Visio templates. All templates are contained in the
All tab within the dialog box.

Sub tabs are provided for various report categories, and contain the following
report options:

: Task Summary Tab

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Report                      Content                                   Excel or

#### Anatomy of a Pivot Table

To understand Visual Reports, some understanding of Pivot Tables is helpful.
Pivot Tables are flexible tables based on measures and dimensions. The
information below is an overview of a Pivot Table based report. Additional
information regarding Pivot Tables can be found in any Excel reference book,
through software Help, or online.

In the table below, sales data from The Chocolate Company shows that sales of
different prod-ucts have occurred in multiple locations. The Chocolate Company
also keeps track of the cus-tomer type and products sold. We might want to know
total sales by customer type, product or location. Pivot Tables have the
flexibility to process any of these report requests quickly.

The data below is the source data that will be used to generate the Pivot
Table:

: Sample data for Pivot table

Pivot Tables are easily changed to create the type of report necessary for your
reporting needs, based on the values contained in the Pivot Table data. Visual
Reports will be used to create the Pivot Diagram or Pivot Table but the project
manager will need to customize the generated re-port.

#### Viewing Visual Reports

Project 2013 comes with built in Visual Report templates to report on cost,
work and resource data. Having a specific goal in mind for the type of report
you want will help generate more meaningful report data.

To open the Visual Reports -- Create Report dialog box:

* Report &rarr; Visual Reports

To create a report:

* Select any report.
* Change timeframe (Days, Weeks, Months) for assignment (usage) data.
* Click **View**.

![Visual Reports selection dialog box.](../assets/12-27-Visual-reports-create.png)

The report will generate by creating an OLAP cube and will open either Visio or
Excel. In the generated Pivot Table select the data to be viewed on the report.
Notice that the data viewed on the table can also be viewed in chart format.

Options are available for saving the generated OLAP cube or creating an Access
database from the data by clicking the Save Data… button.

<aside class="tip callout">
**Tip**: Visual report templates contain Microsoft Project Standard field data.
If customized field data was created, customized templates can be created to
contain the customized fields.
</aside>

### Dashboard Reports

#### What are Dashboard Reports?

Dashboard reports are reports that display project data is tabular and graphic
form. Each report displays different data and can be customized to tailor the
reports for each user's needs. 

#### Introduction to Dashboards

Below is a view of the Overallocated Resources Dashboard Report. Note that it
contains two charts each representing different resource data. The first chart
represents Actual Work v Remaining Work. The second chart displays resources
that are Overallocated at the day level. Each of these reports may be altered
to adjust the chart type, chart elements and details of the display data. 

![Dashboard Report -- Actual Work Versus Remaining Work Chart.](../assets/Dashboard-Report-Actual-Work-Versus-Remaining-Work-Chart.png)

![Dashboard Report -- Overallocated Resources Chart.](../assets/Dashboard-Report-Overallocated-Resources-Chart.png)

#### Data included in the Dashboard Reports

Dashboard Reports contain data relating to project progress, variance
calculations, and critical path. Below is some of the data which are included
in the reports. If you are not using the data needed to populate the reports,
the reports will not display properly. 

Some of the data needed for the reports includes the following project data
values: 

  * Task Duration, Cost and Work. 
  * Resource Cost and Work. 
  * Baseline comparison. 
  * Status date. 
  * Status field: Late, On Time, Future

To Display a Dashboard Report: 

  1. Click on the **Reports** tab.

  2. Click on a Report Category: **Dashboards**, **Resources**, **Costs**, 
     **In Progress**.

     ![Ribbon bar for dashboard reports.](../assets/Report-ribbon-dashboard-reports.png)

  3. Click on a Report to display.

To change parameter values displayed on a Dashboard Report: 

  1. Click on the **Reports** tab

  2. Click on a Report Category: **Dashboards**, **Resources**, **Costs**, 
     **In Progress**.

  3. Click on a Report to display

  4. Click inside of a graph. Options will appear on the right side of the 
     view.

  5. Change options as necessary. Close options by clicking on the X in the 
     upper right corner of the options box. 

  6. Other changes may be made by clicking on formatting changes on the Design 
     tab which will appear when a Report is selected.

     <aside class="note callout">
     **Note**: Changes to Dashboard Reports will be remembered within the file
     and will appear the next time the report is viewed. 
     </aside>

     <aside class="tip callout">
     **Tip**: Clicking on the **Page Breaks** button will display the page
     breaks as they will occur when printing the report. The separate report
     graphics and tables may be dragged to different pages for printing
     purposes.
     </aside>



### Timeline View Report

A timeline is a graphic that is usually displayed with long bars and key dates
or date ranges. To create a high-level timeline report for an executive (or
others who need to see a subset of your schedule), use Timeline view.

#### Customizing Timeline Views

The purpose of the Timeline view is to display project tasks using a timeline
format and export the view to other applications such as Word, Excel, Outlook
and Powerpoint.

Gantt Chart with Timeline is the default view in Project 2013. This view is a
split screen with the Timeline view on the top and the Gantt Chart View on the
bottom.

To turn Timeline view off/on:

* Task &rarr; Gantt Chart
* View &rarr; Timeline

![Spit view section of the View ribbon.](../assets/12-29-Timeline-ribbon-option.png)

Below is a view of the default Timeline view. The Timeline view is showing the
information for the project summary task. The length of the timeline represents
the duration of the project. There is a timeframe window open in the middle to
highlight a specific timeframe:

![Default view of Timeline view.](../assets/12-30-timeline-view--another-option.png)

To format or add more data to the Timeline view:

* Click inside the Timeline view window
* Click on the Format tab

Below is a view of the Timeline Format tab. Use the buttons on this bar to add
additional tasks and format the Timeline view.

![Format ribbon for Timeline View.](../assets/12-30A-Timeline-format-bar.png)

Within the Timeline view there is a timeframe window highlighted in the diagram
below.

  * The Timeframe window may be dragged left and right to emphasize different
    timeframes of the project schedule. The Gantt bars will adjust as the
    timeframe window is moved.

  * Change the timeframe window by clicking in the timeline view and clicking
    the zoom slider in the lower right corner of the screen.

  * The time density of the Timeline view does not have to match the time
    density of the Gantt Chart View.

  * To turn on and off the Timeframe window, click the Pan &amp; Zoom button on the
    Format bar.

  * Use the Date format button on the Format bar to format the dates in the
    Timeline view.

  * Use the Detailed Timeline button to show task names and dates in the view.

The view below shows the standard Timeline view with the Gantt chart view
below:

![Timeline view with Gantt chart.](../assets/12-31-Timeline-with-Gantt.png)

Adding additional tasks to the Timeline view will help build a better picture
of your project. Tasks can be individually included to the Timeline view via
the Task Information dialog box under the General tab. Double click a task to
display the Task Information dialog box.

![Task Information dialog box, General tab showing Display on Timeline option.](../assets/12-32-Task-info-box.png)

The timeline format tab has several command buttons that will help flag tasks
for inclusion into the Timeline view. Clicking the Existing Tasks button will
display a list of all tasks for a project where you can scroll through and
select the tasks you want displayed in the Timeline view.

To add tasks to the timeline view using the Existing Tasks button:

* Click in the Timeline view.
* Click **Existing Tasks**.
* Using the check boxes, select the tasks to add.
* Click **OK** to close.

See below for an example of the Existing Tasks choice list. It is easy to tell
the difference be-tween summary and detail tasks:

![Add Tasks to Timeline dialog box.](../assets/12-33-Add-Tasks-to-Timeline.png)

The timeline view should be planned carefully to create a meaningful report.
Too much information can confuse the reader. Consider creating a high level
tasks report that shows summary sections of work within timeframes. Below is a
view where outline Level 1 tasks have been added to the Timeline view.

To add Outline Level 1 tasks (Summaries) to the Timeline view:

* **Tasks** &rarr; **Gantt Chart**
* **View** &rarr; **Outline** &rarr; **Outline level 1**
* For each summary task to be added to the Timeline view, Select and Right 
  click. Multiple selections may be made.
* Click **Add to timeline**

The Timeline view below, displays Outline Level 1 Summary tasks only and the
Gantt chart display the same Outline Level 1 Summary tasks.

![Timeline View Showing Outline Level 1 Summary Tasks.](../assets/12-34-default-Timeline-with-tasks.png)

Milestone and formatting for the bars can also be added to the Timeline view.

To add a milestone to the Timeline view:

  * **Tasks** &rarr; **Gantt Chart**

  * **View** &rarr; **Filter** &rarr; **Milestone**

  * Select the milestone tasks and right click

  * Click **Add to timeline**.

    To add formatting to the bars, click on the bar and click on a formatting
    tool in the Font section of the Ribbon.

The diagram below displays Outline Level 1 tasks with milestones added and formatting:

![Timeline view with Summary tasks, formatting and milestones.](../assets/12-35-Milestones-added-to-Timeline.png)

Tasks may be added to the project using the Timeline view Format tab. When
adding tasks using these buttons, the tasks will be added to the end of the
project schedule and will start on the first day of the project or the current
date depending on the scheduling option. The choices are:

  * Adding a new task to the timeline
  * Adding a new callout task to the timeline
  * Adding a new milestone to the timeline

Below is a view showing a new callout task and a new milestone added to the
timeline and the project schedule. Callout tasks are originally placed above
the timeline spanning the timeframe of the task. After they are created, they
may be dragged to alternate locations within the Timeline View.

![Timeline view with Call out task and added milestone.](../assets/12-36-Timeline-with-callout-\&-Milestone.png)

To display an existing task as a callout task:

  * Click on a task in the Timeline view
  * Click **Display as a Callout**

To display a Callout task as a bar:

  * Click on the Callout task
  * Click **Display as Bar**

To remove tasks from the Timeline view using the Timeline Format tab:

  * Click the task in the Timeline view
  * Click **Remove from Timeline**

Tasks may be formatted and highlighted as necessary. Text styles and format
buttons are available on the Timeline Format tab. Changing the colors of the
timeline bars is helpful when highlighting information.

<aside class="tip callout">
**Tip**: Too much information results in a hard to read Timeline view. Select
what is important and what will convey your message. The view will become more
meaningful and will result in a useful reporting tool. Typically Summary Tasks
and Milestones are included in the Timeline view which would provide a high
level report.
</aside>

#### Exporting Timeline View

Timeline view is a great visual for executive summaries. To facilitate sharing
information with executives, the Timeline may need to be exported to another
application. 

<aside class="tip callout">
**Tip**: Timeline view must be displayed before you can export it to another
application. The simplest method is to click the Timeline checkbox on the View
tab. If this option is unavailable, you may need to uncheck the Details
checkbox on the same tab.
</aside>

To copy a timeline:

  1. Click inside the Timeline view.

  2. In the **Timeline Tools**, **Format** tab, click on **Copy Timeline** 
     and choose the desired option.

      * **For e-mail** -- Timeline size is reduced to fit into an Outlook 
        message. Small size.

      * **For presentation** -- Optimized for a PowerPoint presentation. 
        Medium size. 

      * **Full Size** -- Uses the full size of the timeline as displayed in 
        Project. Large size. 

You can paste in Outlook to email it to peers or in PowerPoint to format it
further.

![Copy timeline options.](../assets/Copy-timeline.png)

<aside class="tip callout">
**Tip**: You can also save the Timeline as an Adobe Acrobat file using the
File, Export, Create PDF/XPS Document option.
</aside>

## Key Points to Remember

  * Projects can be saved in PDF format to e-mail to others without access to
    Project or when you want to ensure the data does not change. 

  * Print and Page Setup options can be tailored to alter the layout of
    printouts or PDF files. 

  * Use Text Styles to format a specific type of task globally. 

  * Gantt Chart Styles globally change the display of the Gantt bars.

  * Use Bar Styles to format a specific type of Gantt bar globally.

  * Use Layout to modify the link line appearance.
