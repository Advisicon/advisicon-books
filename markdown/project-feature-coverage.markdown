## Which Project Client Should I Use?

Microsoft Project comes in three different desktop clients (Project
Professional, Project Professional for Office 365, and Project Standard), and
two supporting clients: PWA for web browser-based interaction, and Project Lite
for tablet-based interaction.

Each of these different versions of the Project client offer a unique set of
feature coverage. We've grouped Project's features into the following feature
sets:

  * Anywhere Access
  * Work Management
  * Demand Management
  * Portfolio Analytics &amp; Selection
  * Resource Management
  * Schedule Management
  * Financial Management
  * Task &amp; Timesheet Reporting
  * Collaboration
  * Issue &amp; Risk Management
  * Reporting &amp; Business Intelligence
  * Program Management
  * Governance

Use this guide to determine the Project client(s) you'll need to bring your
programs, portfolios, and projects to completion.
